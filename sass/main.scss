        @description:
            You can assign to variables if they aren’t already assigned by adding the !default flag to the end 
            of the value. This means that if the variable has already been assigned to, it won’t be re-assigned, 
            but if it doesn’t have a value yet, it will be given one.

            check the path src/sass/abstracts/variables/_colors.scss with "//theme colors" comment
            
            This is what it looks like: $example: 'value' !default;
